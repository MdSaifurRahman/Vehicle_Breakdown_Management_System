The Two-Wheeler Vehicle Breakdown Management System is a desktop application designed to assist users in efficiently managing and resolving breakdowns of their two-wheeler vehicles. The system provides two interfaces: one for users and another for mechanics, ensuring seamless communication and coordination between them.

When a user encounters a breakdown, they can access the system and fill out a form with their contact details, address, and specific bike information. This information helps in identifying the user and their vehicle accurately.

The system employs a queue-based mechanic allocation mechanism. Based on the availability and workload of mechanics, a suitable mechanic is assigned to the user. This ensures that breakdowns are promptly attended to without unnecessary delays.

Once a mechanic is assigned, the system provides the user with the contact details of the assigned mechanic. This enables direct communication between the user and the mechanic, facilitating coordination and quick resolution of the breakdown issue.

Additionally, the system includes a self-service option for users to perform minor maintenance tasks on their bikes. This empowers users to handle minor issues themselves, thereby reducing dependence on mechanics for every small problem.

Overall, the Two-Wheeler Vehicle Breakdown Management System aims to streamline the process of breakdown management by efficiently connecting users with mechanics and offering self-service options for minor maintenance tasks. This system improves the user experience, minimizes downtime, and enhances the overall efficiency of two-wheeler breakdown management.
